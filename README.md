# My Token Portal 
This project built on top of Node.js is a basic cryptocurrency information portal that uses the coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) API,
to collect and present data about a selected token in real time. It can be used to chart and track price movements, as well as get web alerts or email notifications when
a specific price boundary is crossed. 

The website is live on https://cs396-project.herokuapp.com/
